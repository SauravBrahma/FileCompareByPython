FileCompareByPython

# Description
Test Upload for study...  

This script compares two files in GUI, and written in python3.x.  
And returns the differnes between selected files.

# Caution
Not well-maintained yet for following reasons:  
This script only supports 'utf-8' for now. Will improve this in the future.  
Not all differenes would be shown in the Window, but you can see all the differences in the terminal.  
Sorry for inconvinience.

# Useage
This script can be called from terminal by the following command "python file_compare.py".
